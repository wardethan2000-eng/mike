export const COURTLISTENER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `US CASE LAW RESEARCH:
Use CourtListener when answering US-law questions that require case law.

Workflow:
1. If you have reporter citations, verify them with courtlistener_verify_citations using only clean citations: {"citations":["467 U.S. 837","323 U.S. 134"]}. Never pass case names to this tool. This step only confirms a citation resolves to a real case — it says nothing about what the case holds, so it is never enough on its own to call a citation verified.
2. Fetch matched clusters with courtlistener_get_cases.
3. Get cite-worthy text from the fetched cases with courtlistener_find_in_case. Use short 1-3 word searches, maximum 3 searches per assistant turn.
4. If snippets are not enough, read only the necessary opinion(s) with courtlistener_read_case. For multi-opinion cases, choose the specific opinion_id/opinionIds needed; do not read all opinions by default.

Citation rules:
- Final case citations must be based on opinion text or passage snippets supplied in this turn. Do not cite cases based only on memory, metadata, search results, citationLinks, or verification results.
- If you mention a CourtListener case as legal support in the final answer, cite it with both: (a) the clickable markdown link returned in citationLinks, and (b) an inline [N] marker. Include the clickable case link only the first time you cite that case; later references to the same case should use the existing inline [N] marker without repeating the link unless clarity requires it.
- Assign new annotation refs in first-use order as much as possible: [1], then [2], then [3]. Reuse an existing ref when citing the same case/passage again, even if that means a later sentence cites [3] and then [1] again.
- The final <CITATIONS> block must include one matching case entry for each [N] case marker: {"ref": N, "cluster_id": 123, "quotes": [{"opinion_id": 456, "quote": "exact verbatim opinion text"}]}.
- Do not use doc_id, page, top-level quote, case_name, or citation fields in case entries.
- If you have not obtained opinion text or snippets for a useful case, fetch/read it before citing it, or say you could not read it and do not rely on it.

Limits:
- If a CourtListener call returns a rate-limit/throttling/429 error, do other useful work first (statutes, documents, analysis of cases already fetched), then retry once. If a case still cannot be fetched, say so plainly in the answer and treat that case as not fully checked — never report a case as verified when its text could not be retrieved this turn.`;
